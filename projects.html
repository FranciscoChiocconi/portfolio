                            The objective of our project was to create a game which would be 
                            fun to play and also challenging to create. The game is supposed to engage
                            the player and make them enjoy playing the game. The game itself is placed
                            in space and you play as a space ranger in a space ship. Your main objective
                            is to eliminate the bugs similar to the game galaga. As you kill more bugs the 
                            game gets harder. The bugs start to move faster over time but you also gain
                            upgrades as you kill more bugs. My partner and I decided we wanted to challenge
                            ourselves but we decided that 1 week was not enough to create a game this complex.
                            We remixed the game and we added the tutorial, the upgrades and difficulty increase.
                            Overall this was a very fun project to make being that it was my first ever project
                            in this field of coding. This is the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BdMf1lx7jk2JU9g6VYKtg_QJu-HSAPLHc_1lxiZFd58/edit">rubric</a> which we used to create the project.

                            The objective of the text adventure we created is to entertain the user and enjoy the game we created.
                            In our text adventure you act as a lost person in the woods and we ask a series of
                            questions which will determine if you make it out alive. As you answer the questions,
                            some will bring you closer to safety as some will take you to your death. 
                            When you answer the questions depending on what you answer then it will take you through 
                            a different series of questions. My partner and I were above schedule on the project so 
                            we decided to add a couple of features, like the code not breaking when not acceptable 
                            answers are typed and a couple more stages. This is one of my first ever python projects
                            and I enjoyed it a lot. This definitely helped me learn more about the language and my 
                            interest for it. If you want the rubric this is the <a target="_blank" href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nMqH-R9JE_lgE0ZbBZy3OLaFw9e1TcXvQjJKqSixy1E/edit"> link.<a/>
