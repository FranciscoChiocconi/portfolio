                           From Dallas, Texas, Francisco Chiocconi is a sophomore at Dublin High School. He loves doing many things such as soccer, refereeing, coding and much more. As he grew up his dad has been coding for a long time and Francisco had always had an interest in what he was doing. He believed that he should try to understand what he is doing because it sparked so much interest. Now he is learning to code and wants to work for a larger company, most preferably Google. Google has always been the high point of the computer science realm and he would love to be a part of that community. His plans to reach this goal is to keep practicing major coding languages and keep learning more languages. 
                       </P>
                       <p>
                           Francisco Chiocconi is a very energetic and diligent. He uses his time wisely and always wants to do more. He outputs his energy by playing soccer and refereeing little tots. Also to balance his work and extracurricular activities he does things diligently. He is also very open-minded. When he did the science fair Francisco’s teammates had different viewpoints and ideas than him, but they compromised and thought of an idea. One of his strengths is working with other people, he is very diligent when working in a team and does his part or more if needed.

                           Some achievements have been reached in Francisco Chiocconi life. For example, in the Alameda County Synopsis Science Fair, he won an award for his project. Francisco and his team built a water filter which would filter any water and it is the size of a water bottle. Along with that, he has gotten Principal’s Honor Roll 4 times in Freshman year. He also has the ability to tutor other people if needed and has experience with dealing and taking care of children. He also has a grade 8 certification for refereeing which allows him to referee children and teenagers. That job helped him learn what a job feels like and how it feels to be compensated for working hard.
