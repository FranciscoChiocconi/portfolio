                       </h1>
                       <P>
My name is Francisco Chiocconi, and my goal is to become a Software engineer.  I would like to work at Google to code and improve technology in the world. I am currently an 11th grader at Dublin High School, taking principles of engineering, honors anatomy and AP Spanish. I also do coding in my free time. In order to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer, I will continue to excel at these things, as well as take Engineering classes and code.  I also plan on attending Cal Poly SLO or Pomona and majoring in computer science, in order to continue pursuing my goal.
                       </P>
                       <p>
I have wanted to be a software engineer since I was 14 years old. This career spoke out to me because of the environment which it belongs in. I had a passion for computers, and software engineering is a very interesting branch of the subject. Just over the summer, I was able to have the chance to build myself a computer and it was a fun and great learning experience. My father is also in this field which helped me discover. I spend a lot of time on my computer so this would be a relevant field for me to be in. My dream is to make into a big company or make a company of my own for the better of the world. 

                       </p>
                       <p>
Some personal strengths I have been working well with others, working with computers and communicating in Spanish. I work well with others and try to make the experience pleasurable for the people I am working with. Secondly, I work well with computers in both, hardware and software which can make me a useful tool. I can code as well and I have created websites and programs. Lastly, I am able to communicate in Spanish giving me an advantage and being able to communicate with others in a different language.

                           Some important achievements of mine are winning a prize in the Alameda County Science fair, 3 years of soccer in high school and one year as captain, and Honor roll in 5 semesters of school.

                           While I am only an 11th grader, I have learned a few things about myself. This includes my ability to work with computers, how I positively interact with people and being able to work for long hours.
