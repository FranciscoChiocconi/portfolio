                        The objective of our project was to make a car run on solar panels or 
                        hydrogen fuel cells. Our task was to make a car to drive 1 meter using this
                        alternative energy and our group was able to accomplish it. We had the solar
                        panels and hydrogen connected to a breadboard in series. For the the motor
                        we connected to a 7:3 gear ratio in order to make the vehicle more efficient.
                        We originally started with a smaller one but the gear ratio was too large. When 
                        we tested the 1 meter of the car it took 8.2 seconds and the efficiency of was 22 percent.
                        Overall the project was a success, the car was able to move one meter in a decent time.

                      The objective of our project was to make a bridge that can get the truck across the river.
                      We had constraints in this project such as, at least 12 meters, under 300k, and much more.
                      During this project we expiremented with the program in order to figuire out the 
                      mechanics of bridges in order to create better and cheaper bridges. The final product of our group
                      group was a bridge that cost 248k and could maintain stability the whole time when the truck
                      went over the bridge. We decided to choose this bridge because of it's simplicity
                      and it's cheap price. This project was a challenge and it helped us learn more about 
                      bridges. Overall this project was a success as we were able to create a bridge that fit the 
                      constraints and effectively get the truck from one side to another. This is the <a target="_blank" href ="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gIPARuADIGypGjIXIxELygWVdPrjGCHdP4nFN-2Lgwo/edit">Digital Documentation</a>
